This framework is to help you assess the quality of administrative data for use in the production of official statistics.  

Administrative data is data which has been collected during the operations of an organisation. Government produces a very large amount of administrative data, providing a valuable resource if it can be used correctly. 

However, the data has not been collected for the sole purpose of creating a statistic, and this can lead to challenges when using it for this reason. A summary of these can be found [here](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssa.12315).
