## Welcome to the quality framework for the use of administrative data in statistics.

This framework is to help you assess the quality of administrative data for use in the production of official statistics.  

Administrative data is data which has been collected during the operations of an organisation. Government produces a very large amount of administrative data, providing a valuable resource if it can be used correctly. 

However, the data has not been collected for the sole purpose of creating a statistic, and this can lead to challenges when using it for this reason. A summary of these can be found [here](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssa.12315). 

 

### Quality

Quality is defined as fitness for purpose -  is this data set good enough for what I want to use it for? Where the purpose changes (for example, where the data is collected for one reason then used for another), there should be an assessment of quality to ensure the data you have meets your needs. 

The first step in any quality assessment is deciding what quality looks like for your scenario (what does the data need to have, to do what you want to do), and what is fit for purpose for the user. This decision factors in not only what high quality is to you and your user, but also the time & information you have, as well as any costs associated with conducting assessments or improving aspects of quality.  

 

This framework has been designed to help you make these decisions. It groups the quality assessment into two phases: input and output quality.  

The input quality assesses the data you have coming in the door; how suitable is it for what you want to do with it?  

The output quality assesses the quality of the statistics or analysis you have produced; how well does it meet you and your usersâ€™ needs?  

Both phases use quality dimensions to help you prioritise and assess different aspects of fitness for use. There is some overlap in the wording across the phases, but they are deliberately different as input and output quality. This is because the purpose of the thing you are assessing is different. The data is going to be analysed, the statistic is going to be published or shared. That means there will be different qualities and aspects which you will need to consider. 

Within each section is a description of the dimensions of quality and challenges for each when using administrative data. There are also some questions and tools to guide you through deciding whether this aspect of quality is important for your use case. Finally, there is an introduction to assessing that dimension of quality, with some links to in-depth methods. For brevity and to prevent duplication, these have not been directly included here.

The purpose of this framework is not to answer these questions for you, but to point you towards what you should be thinking about (and doing) in order to understand whether your data and/or your output is fit for use.  

There are often multiple approaches to answering/addressing these questions. This may involve liaising with others within (or outside) your organisation such as data owners to find the answer to a question, accessing and exploring the metadata, or exploring aspects of the dataset/output yourself.  

It is important to have open discussions with your users during this process about their needs. No dataset or output is perfect, but the most crucial element is transparent and clear communication with your users about the data you had, what you did with it, and what that means in terms of quality. This allows the person who is using that statistic to use it in a way which is informed, and any decisions they make with it to include important context.
